PhishShield is an advanced machine learning-powered system that automatically detects phishing websites by analyzing URL characteristics. Built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, it demonstrates applied machine learning for cybersecurity applications and provides real-time protection against malicious websites.

## 🚀 Features

- **🤖 Machine Learning Model**: RandomForestClassifier trained on UCI Phishing Websites Dataset
- **🔍 URL Feature Extraction**: Analyzes 30+ URL characteristics including length, domain structure, special characters
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit-based UI for real-time URL analysis
- **📊 High Accuracy**: Achieves 83.5% accuracy with comprehensive evaluation metrics
- **📈 Feature Importance**: Identifies the most critical features for phishing detection
- **💾 Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models using joblib
- **📓 Complete Analysis**: Comprehensive Jupyter notebook with full data science workflow

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PhishShield.git
cd PhishShield
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Train the model (optional):**
```bash
python3 phishshield.py
```

## 🎯 Usage

### 🌐 Web Interface (Recommended)
Run the Streamlit app for an interactive experience:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` and enter URLs to analyze.

### 📓 Jupyter Notebook Analysis
Open `PhishShield.ipynb` to explore the complete data analysis, model training, and evaluation process:
```bash
jupyter notebook PhishShield.ipynb
```

### 💻 Command Line Usage
```python
from phishshield import PhishShieldDetector

# Load pre-trained model
detector = PhishShieldDetector('model.pkl')

# Analyze a URL
result = detector.predict("https://suspicious-site.com")
print(f"Prediction: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.3f}")
print(f"Phishing Probability: {result['phishing_probability']:.3f}")
```

## 📊 Model Performance

The RandomForestClassifier achieves excellent performance:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 83.5% |
| **ROC AUC** | 0.85+ |

2. **Question marks** (14.2%) - Query parameters
3. **Dots** (7.2%) - Domain separators
4. **URL length** (2.9%) - Total URL length
5. **Ampersands** (2.7%) - Parameter separators
6. **Character 'i' count** (2.4%) - Character frequency
7. **Path length** (2.1%) - URL path length
8. **Hash symbols** (2.1%) - Fragment identifiers
9. **Suspicious keywords** (2.1%) - Security-related terms
10. **HTTP protocol** (2.1%) - Non-secure connections

## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the UCI Phishing Websites Dataset, which contains 30 features extracted from legitimate and phishing URLs:

- **URL Structure**: Length, dots, slashes, special characters
- **Domain Analysis**: Subdomains, IP addresses, registration length
- **Security Features**: SSL certificates, HTTPS tokens, favicon
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Redirects, popups, iframes, abnormal URLs
- **Content Analysis**: Links, anchors, form submissions
